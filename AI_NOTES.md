# AI_NOTES

## What AI was used for
- Drafting initial architecture and endpoint breakdown.
- Generating starter structure for Next.js route handlers and client components.
- Refining UI/UX with Tailwind utility classes and interaction states.
- Producing initial copy for docs and setup notes.

## What I verified manually
- Requirement mapping against the assignment checklist.
- Data model consistency between Prisma schema, API responses, and UI types.
- Input validation rules and empty/wrong input handling.
- Status page behavior for backend, database, and LLM checks.
- Drag-and-drop reordering behavior and export button loading states.

## LLM provider and model choice
- Provider: Google Gemini API
- Model (default): `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`

Reason:
- Good quality-speed-cost balance for short structured planning outputs.
- Reliable JSON generation when combined with schema-constrained prompting.
